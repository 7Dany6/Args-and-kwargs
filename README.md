# Args_and_kwargs
Functions are building blocks in Python. They take zero or more arguments and return a value. 
Python is pretty flexible in terms of how arguments are passed to a function. 
The *args and **kwargs make it easier and cleaner to handle arguments.
The important parts are “*” and “**”. 
You can use any word instead of args and kwargs but it is the common practice to use the words args and kwargs. 
Thus, there is no need for unnecessary adventures.
